## 🧬 AI Researcher | Computational Biologist | HPC & Math Enthusiast

I am an eternal student of Artificial Intelligence with a deep-rooted passion for the hardcore mathematics that power foundational models. My primary obsession lies at the intersection of AI and **Computational Biology**, where I apply advanced machine learning techniques to accelerate **drug discovery** and **enzyme engineering**.

Beyond the application layer, I am deeply fascinated by the theoretical foundations of deep learning. In my free time, I enjoy exploring differential geometry, particularly **tensor algebra**, **Riemannian manifolds**, and **parallel tensors**. Currently, I am moving down the stack to master hardware-level execution, writing custom kernels to understand the exact mechanics of GPU compute during training and inference.

### 🚀 What I'm up to

- 🔭 **I’m currently working on:** Developing ****[molfun](https://github.com/rubencr14/molfun)****, an open-source framework designed for finetuning structural and sequence models like *OpenFold*, *Boltz*, various biological embeddings, and *de novo* generation models such as *RFdiffusion*. The project is built to seamlessly test novel architectures and run comprehensive benchmarking.
- 🌱 **I’m currently learning:** Low-level GPU architecture, custom kernel development (CUDA/Triton), and the intricate mechanics of hardware optimization for AI training and inference.
- 👯 **I’m looking to collaborate on:** Open-source projects related to AI in biotech, structure-based drug design, foundational models for biology, or High-Performance Computing (HPC) optimizations.
- 💬 **Ask me about:** Tensor algebra, Riemannian geometry, the mathematical proofs behind neural networks, and how AI is revolutionizing protein engineering.
- 📫 **How to reach me:** [rubencr14@gmail.com](mailto:rubencr14@gmail.com) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rubencr14/)
- ⚡ **Fun fact:** I consider discussing Riemannian manifolds and parallel transport a perfectly valid and relaxing hobby.
